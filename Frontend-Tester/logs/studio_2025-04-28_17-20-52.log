2025-04-28 17:25:57 - INFO - Generating image from text: 'A young adult male, South Asian ethnicity, medium height, slim build, with a soft oval face, fair-medium skin tone, and short black side-swept hair. He smiles warmly with dark brown eyes and no visible facial hair. He wears a crisp white button-down shirt, smooth cotton fabric, with no accessories. Seated upright facing directly at the camera, hands resting gently on a desk, one hand loosely gripping a pen. Background is an office with a brown cushioned chair, beige wall with horizontal white stripes, and a cluttered side desk filled with colorful paper stacks. Lighting is soft and even. Style is photorealistic with smooth, slightly enhanced sharpness. No text overlays.'
