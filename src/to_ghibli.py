His medium brown skin is complemented by dark, slightly curly hair styled upwards.  His dark brown eyes widen slightly in a focused expression as he eats. He wears a black and white horizontally striped cotton polo shirt, seemingly casual. His hands hold a fork, bringing food to his mouth; his posture is slightly hunched forward, facing the camera at a 45Â° angle.  He appears engrossed in his meal, conveying a sense of enjoyment.

The background is a dimly lit restaurant booth.  Dark brown leather seating contrasts with beige textured wall paneling. A dark wooden table holds a large, sizzling stone plate filled with a colorful mix of meat, vegetables (peas, green beans, spinach), and fried items. Warm, soft lighting accentuates the steam rising from the food. The overall mood is intimate and warm. The image style is photorealistic, with a slightly soft focus, and has a high resolution feel. There are no text overlays or visual effects."""
